// a System One request naming it (/v1/systemone, "group/<id>" or the
// group's id or name) goes to its models as a conversation goes to a
// chat group's, the next asked when one fails. It holds no conversation,
// so it is kept out of the agents' catalog, a chat group can't hold it,
// and it takes nothing that shapes a conversation: no patterns, rules,
// classifier, effort, levels or fast mode.

// "provider/model" whose provider answers model at its decision API, on
// or not. A group, or a member with an effort of its own, is not one.
